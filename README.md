Overview of the Project
This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a Wolt-like delivery service. The dataset includes customer registration details, purchase history, and payment method status. The primary goal is to gain insights into customer behavior through exploratory data analysis (EDA), business metric evaluation, customer segmentation, and predictive modeling.

First, the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and format inconsistencies. Then, EDA is performed to explore trends such as registration growth, purchase behavior, and user activity. Key business metrics like conversion rate, retention rate, and average order value are computed to assess overall performance.

A machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) is implemented to predict whether a customer has a valid payment method. Additionally, K-Means clustering is used to segment customers based on their purchase patterns. This project provides actionable insights that businesses can use to enhance marketing strategies and user retention.

Problem of the Project
Online delivery services face challenges like low customer retention, inactive users, and predicting payment method adoption. Many registered users never make purchases, making it crucial to identify engagement patterns. Predicting valid payment methods helps businesses target users effectively. Customer segmentation is also vital for personalized marketing, as a generic approach reduces effectiveness. This project uses data-driven techniquesto optimize decision-making, improve customer retention, and enhance business performance.

Objectives of the Project
1.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

To identify trends in customer registration, purchase activity, and user engagement.

2.Evaluate Key Business Metrics:

To compute conversion rate, retention rate, and purchase frequency to assess business performance.

3.Build a Predictive Model for Payment Method Adoption:

To use machine learning to predict whether a user has a valid payment method.

4.Segment Customers for Targeted Marketing:

To apply clustering techniques (K-Means) to categorize customers based on spending patterns.
